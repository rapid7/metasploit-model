    # Metasploit::Model follows the {http://semver.org/  Semantic Versioning Specification}.  At this time, the API is
    # considered unstable because certain code may not be shared between metasploit_data_models, metasploit-framework,
    # and pro, so support code for that may be removed in the future.  Because of the unstable API the version should
    # remain below 1.0.0

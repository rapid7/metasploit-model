## [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

### Terminology

* "Enhancements" are widdening the API, such as by adding new classes or methods.
* "Bug Fixes" are fixes to the implementation that do not affect the public API.  If the public API is affected then
  the change should be listed as both a "Bug Fix" and either an "Enhancement" or "Incompatible Change" depending on how
  the bug was fixed.
* "Deprecations" are changes to the implementation that cause deprecation warnings to be issued for APIs which will be
  removed in a future major release.  "Deprecations" are usually accompanied by an Enhancement that creates a new API
  that is meant to be used in favor of the deprecated API.
* "Incompatbile Changes" are the removal of classes or methods or new required arguments or setup that shrink the API.
  It is best practice to make a "Deprecation" for the API prior to its removal.

### Task List

- [ ] Generate the list of changes since the last release: `git log v<LAST_MAJOR>.<LAST_MINOR>.<LAST_PATCH>..HEAD`
- [ ] For each commit in the release, find the corresponding PR by search for the commit on Github.
- [ ] For each PR, determine whether it is an Enhancement, Bug Fix, Deprecation, and/or Incompatible Change.  A PR can
      be in more than one category, in which case it should be listed in each category it belongs, but with a category
      specific description of the change.
- [ ] Add an item to each category's list in the following format: `[#<PR>](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-model/pull/<PR>) <consumer summary> - [@<github_user>](https://github.com/<github_user>)`
      `consumer_summary` should be a summary of the Enhancement, Bug Fix, Deprecation, or Incompatible Change from a
      downstream consumer's of the library's perspective.  `github_user` should be Github handle of the author of the
      PR.
- [ ] If you added any Deprecations or Incompatible Changes, then adding upgrading information to
      [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md)

## `VERSION`

The entries in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) can be used to help determine how the `VERSION` should be bumped.

### Bug fixes

If the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) contains only Bug Fixes for the Next Release, then increment
[`PATCH`](lib/metasploit/model/version.rb).

### Compatible API changes

If the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) contains any Enhancements or Deprecations, then increment
[`MINOR`](lib/metasploit/model/version.rb) and reset [`PATCH`](lib/metasploit/model/version.rb) to `0`.

### Incompatible API changes

If the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) contains any Incompatible Change, then increment
[`MAJOR`](lib/metasploit/model/version.rb) and reset [`MINOR`](lib/metasploit/model/version.rb and
[`PATCH`](lib/metasploit/model/version.rb) to `0`.

## Setup [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for next release

- [ ] Change `Next Release` section name at the top of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) to match the current `VERSION`.
- [ ] Add a new `Next Release` section above the `VERSION`'s section you just renamed:
<pre>
# Next Release

* Enhancements
* Bug Fixes
* Deprecations
* Incompatible Changes
</pre>
